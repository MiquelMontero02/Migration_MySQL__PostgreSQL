# Migration_MySQL__PostgreSQL
Hi, my name is Miquel and this is one of the most interesting projects that i made in my degree. It's abaout take information from CSV and create a DataBase in MySQL that could capture al the data. After that, we should migrate this information to PostgreSQL with the pgloader tool.
In this paper you will be able to see necessary roles, tablespaces and optimization to imporve the system behaviour as much as possible.
